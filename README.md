Public repo for Derek Ferguson's 2020 ByteMyCode presentation

The "convertor.ipynb" file in the root of the file system would ideally be in the Demo1 folder, since this goes with the first demo.  Unfortunately it has internal references to this Git location and I built it before I had a proper placement.  So -- it'll have to live here until I rebuild it.
