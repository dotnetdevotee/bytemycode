Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun.,serious
"It’s not visible to the naked eye, and became the first planet discovered with the use of a telescope.",serious
Uranus is tipped over on its side with an axial tilt of 98 degrees.,serious
It is often described as “rolling around the Sun on its side.”,serious
Uranus was officially discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1781.,serious
It is too dim to have been seen by the ancients.,serious
"At first Herschel thought it was a comet, but several years later it was confirmed as a planet.",serious
Herscal tried to have his discovery named “Georgian Sidus” after King George III. ,serious
The name Uranus was suggested by astronomer Johann Bode. ,serious
The name comes from the ancient Greek deity Ouranos.,serious
"Uranus turns on its axis once every 17 hours, 14 minutes.",serious
"The planet rotates in a retrograde direction, opposite to the way Earth and most other planets turn.",serious
Uranus makes one trip around the Sun every 84 Earth years.,serious
During some parts of its orbit one or the other of its poles point directly at the Sun and get about 42 years of direct sunlight. ,serious
Uranus is often referred to as an “ice giant” planet.,serious
"Like the other gas giants, it has a hydrogen upper layer, which has helium mixed in.",serious
"Below that is an icy “mantle, which surrounds a rock and ice core.",serious
"The upper atmosphere is made of water, ammonia and the methane ice crystals that give the planet its pale blue colour.",serious
Uranus hits the coldest temperatures of any planet.,serious
With minimum atmospheric temperature of -224°C Uranus is nearly coldest planet in the solar system.,serious
While Neptune doesn’t get as cold as Uranus it is on average colder.,serious
The upper atmosphere of Uranus is covered by a methane haze which hides the storms that take place in the cloud decks.,serious
Uranus has two sets of very thin dark coloured rings.,serious
There are eleven inner rings and two outer rings. ,serious
They probably formed when one or more of Uranus’s moons were broken up in an impact.,serious
The first rings were discovered in 1977 with the two outer rings being discovered in Hubble Space Telescope images between 2003 and 2005.,serious
Uranus’ moons are named after characters created by William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.,serious
"Uaranus' moons include Oberon, Titania and Miranda.",serious
All Uranus' moons are frozen worlds with dark surfaces.,serious
Some of Uranus' moons are ice and rock mixtures.,serious
"The most interesting Uranian moon is Miranda; it has ice canyons, terraces, and other strange-looking surface areas.",serious
Only one spacecraft has flown by Uranus.,serious
"In 1986, the Voyager 2 spacecraft swept past the planet at a distance of 81,500 km.",serious
"Voyager 2 returned the first close-up images of the planet, its moons, and rings.",serious
63 Earths would fit inside Uranus (64 if you relax).,comedic
